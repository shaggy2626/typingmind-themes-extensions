### 5. Web Search (OpenAI)

**File:** [`extensions/web-search-openai/web-search-openai.js`](./extensions/web-search-openai/web-search-openai.js)

**Extension URL:**
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shaggy2626/typingmind-themes-extensions@latest/extensions/web-search-openai/web-search-openai.js
```

Enable OpenAI's browsing automatically when using GPT‑5 models. This extension only affects GPT‑5 (it does nothing for other models). It injects the `web_search_preview` tool into OpenAI Responses API requests based on your preferences and the selected reasoning effort, without altering your other tools.

> Note: This uses OpenAI's official Web Search tool — the same browsing capability available natively in ChatGPT. See the [OpenAI Web Search tool docs (Responses API mode)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses).

**Features:**
- **Web context amount:** Choose how much web context to include; your choice is remembered.
- **Options:**
  - **high**: Most comprehensive context, slower response.
  - **medium (default)**: Balanced context and latency.
  - **low**: Least context, fastest response, but potentially lower answer quality.
- **Timezone:** Set your timezone (auto‑detected); pick another if you prefer. The list is fetched from `timeapi.io` and cached for 7 days.
- **Easy settings:** Find it under Global Settings → Models ("Web search (GPT‑5 only)").
- **When it turns on:** Applies only if the model is GPT‑5 and reasoning effort is **Low/Medium/High**. OpenAI does not support Web Search when reasoning is **Minimal**, so the tool will not be added (and is removed if present). 
- **Tool safety:** Only adds/updates/removes the `web_search_preview` tool; all other tools remain untouched. Updates existing entries even if wrapped or named differently to avoid duplicates.
- **Local storage used:** `1stop-web-search-context` (`off|low|medium|high`) and `1stop-web-search-timezone` (IANA timezone).

**Extension URL:**
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shaggy2626/typingmind-themes-extensions@latest/extensions/image-viewer/image-viewer.js
